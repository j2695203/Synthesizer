# SoundWave Synthesizer

The SoundWave Synthesizer project is a Java-based endeavor aimed at creating a comprehensive sound synthesizer. It encompasses multiple components, including signal generators, filters, and mixers, to enable the creation of diverse sounds.

## Key Features:

- **Core Components Development:** The project begins with the development of core components, such as signal generators for generating simple noises (like sine waves), filters for modifying sounds, and mixers for combining different sounds together.

- **Audio Clip Handling:** The project works with mono audio clips with a sample rate of 44.1 KHz and 16 bits per sample, each lasting for 2 seconds. This involves handling audio data as arrays of bytes to utilize the Audio library effectively.

- **JavaFX GUI Integration:** The synthesizer is integrated with a JavaFX GUI, featuring controls for interacting with various audio components. Users can adjust parameters and play synthesized sounds through the GUI interface.

- **Dynamic Component Interaction:** The GUI allows dynamic interaction between audio components, enabling users to connect different components together visually. This facilitates easy configuration and manipulation of the sound synthesis process.

- **Testing and Refinement:** Thorough JUnit tests are implemented to ensure the functionality and reliability of each component. Additionally, the project undergoes continuous refinement and improvement to enhance its capabilities and usability.

## Usage:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile and run the JavaFX application.
3. Explore the GUI interface to interact with different audio components.
4. Experiment with connecting components and adjusting parameters to create unique sounds.

Enjoy the noise! ðŸ˜œ ðŸŽ¹
